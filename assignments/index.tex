	The X-Cache is used to hasten the process of loading the website for the user. So instead of going to the original servers the clients request is caught by the Content Delivery Network and processed immediately.

	The Transfer-Encoding header specifies the form of encoding used to safely transfer the payload body to the user.

	Transfer-Encoding is a hop-by-hop header, that is applied to a message between two nodes, not to a resource itself. Each segment of a multi-node connection can use different Transfer-Encoding values. If you want to compress data over the whole connection, use the end-to-end Content-Encoding header instead.

	\section{}
	A cache control describes information regarding the expiration of a the resources to that page. For example the timeout for that page due to inactivity.
